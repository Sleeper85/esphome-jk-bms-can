## Number of BMS supported

**Warning:** BMS monitoring with `UART` or `RS485` is recommended, however, if you want to monitor your BMS with `Bluetooth`, please choose an `ESP32-S3`.

* 3x BMS with `Bluetooth` (BLE stack consumes significant amount of RAM on device and can cause crash and reboot)
* 3x `JK-B` BMS with `UART`
* several `JK-PB` BMS with `RS485` (already tested with 7 BMS)

Note: these are theoretical limits, not all combinations have been tested.

## UART/IO Expander

It would be possible to add one or more [WK2168 4x UART expander](https://esphome.io/components/weikai.html) to increase the number of BMS monitored with `UART`.

## Build your own PCB

This is an example of an ESP32 DevKit V1 30 pin board powered by the BMS.
