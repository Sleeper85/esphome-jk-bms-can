## Buy the M5Stack Atom CAN Kit (the Plug & Play solution)

**Warning: Atom S3 provides very few GPIOs, this solution can work to monitor up to 3x BMS with `Bluetooth`, 2x BMS (JK-B) with `UART` (the second UART must be soldered on the Atomic CAN base on GPIOs G7 and G8) or several BMS (JK-PB) with `RS485` (already tested with 7 BMS).**

If soldering or creating your own board seems complicated to you, know that it is possible to use the Atom CAN Kit from M5Stack.<br>

**Choose Atom S3 (display) or Atom S3 Lite + Atomic CAN base.**
