# This file optimizes the use of the ESP32-S3 PSRAM by authorizing or
# forcing certain data to be written to the PSRAM rather than to the
# internal RAM.
# The configuration presented here already seems stable for several
# users and visibly offers better behavior of the esp when it contains
# a lot of entities.
