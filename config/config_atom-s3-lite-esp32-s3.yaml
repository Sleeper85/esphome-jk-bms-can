# *** These are the specific settings you need to change in the YAML if you use the Atom S3 Lite ESP32-S3 board ***

# 1) Choose the configuration file you want to use:
#    - esp32_ble_jk-bms-can.yaml :  If you don't want to connect a wire between the BMS and the ESP32 choose the Bluetooth version.
#    - esp32_wire_jk-bms-can.yaml : If you prefer to use a wired connection between the BMS and the ESP32 choose the Wire version.

# 2) Edit the YAML file you have chosen with the information below :

# +--------------------------------------+
# | ESP32 CAN/serial port pins           |
# +--------------------------------------+
# GPIO pins your CAN bus transceiver ATOMIC CANBus Base (CA-IS3050G)
  can_tx_pin: GPIO5
  can_rx_pin: GPIO6
# GPIO pins your JK-BMS UART-TTL is connected to the grove port of Atom Lite
  tx_pin: GPIO1
  rx_pin: GPIO2
